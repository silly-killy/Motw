**Scene:**  
Night. A small farmhouse on the edge of town.  
We see **a teen girl, Emily**, reading in her bedroom. A soft **tap-tap-tap** comes from her window.

She looks — standing just beyond the glass, at the treeline, is **her father**. He’s smiling in the dark.  
But… her father’s been dead for 3 years.

Emily: “…Dad?”  
The figure raises its hand and waves… but the wave is _too slow_.  
When it steps forward, its legs bend strangely, too long, each stride stiff then loose in unnatural rhythm.

Emily freezes.  
“Come here, sweetheart,” the voice says — and it’s _exactly_ her father’s voice.

The light in her room flickers.  
By the time it steadies, the figure is right at the glass, face pressed to it, grinning.
